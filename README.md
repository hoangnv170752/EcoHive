## 2. Problem Statement

Environmental challenges such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution are global crises requiring immediate, coordinated efforts. Despite increasing awareness, current platforms fail to provide a dedicated space for eco-enthusiasts to network, collaborate, and fund their projects efficiently. Existing social media platforms dilute environmental content among various topics, making it difficult for initiatives to gain visibility and momentum. Additionally, traditional fundraising methods lack transparency and security, leading to mistrust and reduced donor engagement. There is a lack of a platform focusing on environmental events, fundraising, and fostering collaboration, which hampers the ability of eco-advocates to connect and mobilize effectively for impactful change.
